Energy Harvesting Shoe Module with Arduino

This project demonstrates how human walking motion can be converted into electrical energy using piezoelectric discs embedded in a shoe. The generated energy is boosted using a DC-DC boost converter and stored in a rechargeable Li-ion battery, which can later power or charge small devices (phones, smartwatches, headphones).
